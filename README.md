                                               Heart-Disease-Prediction-using-R
Prediction system which uses the concept of Logistic Regression with a single independent variable AND multiple independent variables so we can fully understand how it it works. 

Steps involved: 

1. Load and format data <br />
2. Dealing with missing data <br />
3. Verifying that the data is not imbalanced <br />
4. Logistic regression with one independent variable <br /> 
5. Logistic regression with many independent variables <br />
6. Graphing the predicted probabilities <br />
